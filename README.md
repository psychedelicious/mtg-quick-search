# MTG Quick Search

Web extension to look up MTG cards. Compatible with FF and Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Brave).

![example](https://github.com/psychedelicious/mtg-quick-search/blob/master/images/example.gif?raw=true)

Pending publication to the Firefox and Chrome extension stores.

Please report any issues here.

## Installation

Until the extension is on the FF and Chrome web stores, you can install it manually. [Download from Releases](https://github.com/psychedelicious/mtg-quick-search/releases/tag/latest).

### Installation - Firefox

**The signed build is pending Mozilla. You will need to install the unsigned version for now.**

When using normal Firefox, you can only install it as a temporary add-on:

- Go to `about:debugging`
- Click `This Firefox`
- Click `Load Temporary Add-on...`
- Select the unsigned zip

When using the Nightly/Developer Firefox builds, you can install it the same way you would install a signed version, after setting `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config`.

Once the signed version is available:

- Download the latest signed release
- Click Tools > Add-ons and Themes > gear icon > Install Add-on from File... > select the zip

### Installation - Chrome

- Download the latest release
- Unzip it to its own folder
- Click Chrome > Preferences > Extensions > enable Developer Mode > Load unpacked > select the unzipped folder

## Usage

Select a card name (or any text) and search for it using:

- The **MTG Quick Search** right-click menu button
- Keyboard shortcut `Opt`+`Shift`+`S` (`Alt`+`Shift`+`S` on Windows)

The search only displays a card if there is exactly one match. You can try searching Scryfall if there are no matches, multiple matches, or something else goes awry.

- X => close popup
- G => open card on Gatherer
- S => open card on Scryfall
- E => open card on EDHREC
- â†º => flip card (if it is double-faced)
- `Escape` => close popup

You can open as many cards as you like, move them around, etc - try it out.

## Build from source

### Build - Firefox

You can build an unsigned version for testing, or a signed (probably don't want to do this though).

#### Build - Firefox - Unsigned

`yarn run build-ff` outputs an unsigned build to `build/firefox/`.

#### Build - Firefox - Signed

You probably don't want to do this - just download the latest signed Firefox release if you want to run the extension on Firefox.

You would do this if you wanted to publish a fork of this extension for some reason - I'd prefer a pull request, though.

This requires Mozilla Add-on API credentials. The build script expects the JWT issuer to be in an environment variable `MOZ_API_ISSUER` and the JWT secret to be in `MOZ_API_SECRET`.

`yarn run build-ff-signed` builds and signs the extension with Mozilla, outputting a zip file to `build/firefox_signed`.

The signed extension can be installed from file per usual.

### Build - Chrome

`yarn run build-chrome` outputs a build to `build/firefox/`.

## Technical

Built in React. Uses [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)'s generously provided free API.
